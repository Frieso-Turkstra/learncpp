/*
Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items:
health potions, torches, and arrows.
Create an enum to identify the different types of items,
and an std::array to store the number of each item the player is carrying
(the enumerators are used as indexes of the array).
The player should start with 2 health potions, 5 torches, and 10 arrows.
Write a function called countTotalItems() that returns how many items the player has in total.
Have your main() function print the output of countTotalItems() as well as the number of torches.
