/*
In designing a game, we decide we want to have monsters,
because everyone likes fighting monsters.
Declare a struct that represents your monster.
The monster should have a type that can be one of the following:
an ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime.
Use an enum class for this.

Each individual monster should also have a name
(use a std::string or std::string_view),
as well as an amount of health that represents
how much damage they can take before they die.
Write a function named printMonster()
that prints out all of the structâ€™s members.
Instantiate an ogre and a slime,
initialize them using an initializer list,
and pass them to printMonster().
